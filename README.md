# AirBnB Clone - The Console
The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

#### How does the command interpreter manage AirBnB objects?
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
